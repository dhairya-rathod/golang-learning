### Data types

Go has various data types `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `float`.&nbsp;

### Variable

There can be package level variables or function level variables (In other words scope of the variable can be package or function).&nbsp;

### Slices

Slices are an important data type in Go, giving a more powerful interface to sequences than arrays.&nbsp;
