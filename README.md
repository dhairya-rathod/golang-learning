# GoLang Learning

### Data types

Go's basic types are' `string`, Integer `int32`, `int64`, Boolean `bool`, Float `float32`, `float64`.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/01-data-types/main.go)_

### Variable

The `var` statement declares a variable. There can be package level variables or function level variables (In other words scope of the variable can be package or function).&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/02-variables/main.go)_

### Constants

Constants are declared like variables, but with the `const` keyword. Contain values that never change during execution of program or are immutable.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/03-constants/main.go)_

### Arrays

In Go, an array is a numbered sequence of elements of a specific length.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/04-arrays/main.go)_

### Slices

Slices are an important data type in Go, giving a more powerful interface to sequences than arrays.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/05-slices/main.go)_

### Slicing

Go allow us to slice a slice or an array which is called slicing.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/06-slicing/main.go)_

### String Slicing | Substring method

Go allow us to slice a string also.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/07-string-utils/main.go)_

### Map Data Structure

Map data structure in go is used to store key-value pair.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/08-map/main.go)_

### Struct

Go struct allow us define our own custom data type.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/09-struct/main.go)_

### If/Else

Go allow us create conditional statement using if/else.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/10-conditional-statement/main.go)_

### Variable Scope

Go has package, function and block level scope.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/11-variable-scope/main.go)_

### Loops

Go has only for loop which is capable of replicating for, while and do-while loop.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/12-loops/main.go)_

### Statement | Label

Some of the control flow statement supported by golang are `break`, `continue`, `label` and `goto`.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/13-control-flow-statement/main.go)_

### Switch

Like other languages `break` statement is not required at the end of each case in golang.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/14-switch/main.go)_

### Function

In golang main function is an entrypoint. It takes no params also return nothing.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/15-functions/main.go)_

### Pointers

Pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of a value.&nbsp;
_More details [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/16-pointers/main.go)_
