# GoLang Learning

### Data types

Go's basic types are' `string`, Integer `int32`, `int64`, Boolean `bool`, Float `float32`, `float64`.&nbsp;
_Detailed explanation [here](https://github.com/dhairya-rathod/golang-learning/blob/master/01-data-types/main.go)_

### Variable

The `var` statement declares a variable. There can be package level variables or function level variables (In other words scope of the variable can be package or function).&nbsp;

### Constants

Constants are declared like variables, but with the `const` keyword. Contain values that never change during execution of program or are immutable.&nbsp;

### Arrays

In Go, an array is a numbered sequence of elements of a specific length.&nbsp;

### Slices

Slices are an important data type in Go, giving a more powerful interface to sequences than arrays.&nbsp;

### Slicing

Go allow us to slice a slice or an array which is called slicing.&nbsp;
